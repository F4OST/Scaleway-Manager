  <h6>Who created this app ?</h6>
  <p>I am only one developer who basically wanted to create a Scaleway application for personal use and then realized
    that it could be useful for many other people. I'm a student in France in an IT school.</p>
  <br/>
  <h6>Is this an official application published by Scaleway ?</h6>
  <p>Absolutely not ! Before creating the app I asked Scaleway if I could publish it and they give me their
    agreement. So here we are !</p>
  <br/>
  <h6>Why did you created this application ?</h6>
  <p>As Scaleway is based on time = money, I wanted an easier way to start/stop my servers to save money and I think an
    application is the solution. You can start and stop it in just one click.</p>
  <br/>
  <h6>What about our data/privacy ?</h6>
  <p>I do not sell or personally use your data at any moment. I just use Scaleway API to allow you to connect, get your
    servers, start them, ect. Also if you're worried about your account security I recommend you to activate Two-Factor
    Authentication.</p>
  <br/>
  <h6>Why is this application free and without ads ?</h6>
  <p>I'm not a big fan of advertising, I think it destroy the design of an application. And the application will be free
    because I'm not in need of money. Maybe later I will open a donation system to offset the expenses I made in
    publishing the app.</p>
  <br/>
  <h6>I have other questions, where can I ask ?</h6>
  <p>At the home page you have an icon of a life buoy on the bottom where you can find my website, a way to contact me or to report a
    bug. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions!</p>
